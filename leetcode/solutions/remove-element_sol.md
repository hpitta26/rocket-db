### 1. Two Pointers Approach

This approach uses two pointers to overwrite elements that equal `val`.

#### Time Complexity: O(n)
#### Space Complexity: O(1)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Initialize the pointer for the position to place the next element
        k = 0
        
        # Iterate through the array
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # If the current element is not equal to val
            if nums[i] != val:
                # Place it at the position k and increment k
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                k += 1
        
        # Return the count of elements not equal to val
        return k
```

### 2. Two Pointers (Optimized for Case with Few Elements to Remove)

When there are few elements to remove, we can optimize by swapping elements from the end.

#### Time Complexity: O(n)
#### Space Complexity: O(1)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Edge case: empty array
        if not nums:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize pointers
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        # Process until pointers meet
        while left <= right:
            # If left element equals val, swap with right element
            if nums[left] == val:
                nums[left] = nums[right]
                right -= 1
            else:
                # If left element is not val, move to the next element
                left += 1
        
        # Return the count of elements not equal to val
        return left
```

### 3. Filter Approach (Not In-Place)

This approach creates a new array without the target value, then copies it back.
Note: This doesn't strictly follow the in-place requirement.

#### Time Complexity: O(n)
#### Space Complexity: O(n)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # Filter out all elements equal to val
        filtered = [num for num in nums if num != val]
        
        # Copy the filtered elements back to nums
        for i in range(len(filtered)):
            nums[i] = filtered[i]
        
        # Return the count of elements not equal to val
        return len(filtered)
```

## Key Insights

1. **In-Place Modification**: The problem requires modifying the array in-place, without creating additional arrays.

2. **Two Pointers**: This is a classic application of the two-pointer technique. The first approach uses one pointer to track the position for placing elements, and another to scan the array.

3. **Optimization Opportunity**: The second approach is optimized for cases where there are few elements to remove, reducing the number of operations.

4. **Order Flexibility**: Since the problem allows changing the order of elements, we can use swapping to simplify the implementation.

## Common Mistakes

1. Creating a new array instead of modifying the original one in-place.
2. Not returning the correct count of remaining elements (k).
3. Incorrectly handling edge cases like empty arrays.
4. Forgetting to update the array elements (only returning the count).

## Performance Comparison

1. **Standard Two Pointers**: Simple and effective for all cases, with O(n) time complexity.

2. **Optimized Two Pointers**: More efficient when there are few elements to remove, as it reduces the number of assignments.

3. **Filter Approach**: Conceptually simpler but uses O(n) extra space, which doesn't strictly meet the in-place requirement.

For most cases, the standard two-pointer approach is recommended for its simplicity and consistent performance. If you expect most elements to be kept, the optimized two-pointer approach can be more efficient.
